/*Which loop is better FOR or WHILE loop? Which one is more efficient? How do you decide which loop to use. */

The choice between a for loop and a while loop in C largely depends on the specific requirements of the task being performed. Both loops can be used to execute a block of code multiple times, but they have different strengths and use cases.
For loops are well-suited for tasks where the number of iterations is known in advance or can be easily calculated. For example, if you want to iterate over an array of 10 elements, a for loop would be a good choice. The for loop allows you to specify the loop control variable and the iteration step in a compact and convenient format.
While loops are best used when the number of iterations is not known beforehand and must be determined based on some condition. For example, if you want to keep reading input from the user until they enter a specific value, a while loop would be a good choice.
